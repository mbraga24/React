import React from 'react';

/*
  Programming Pattern:
  In this programming pattern, the container component does the work of
  figuring out what to display. The presentational component does the work
  of actually displaying it. If a component does a significant amount of
  work in both areas, then thatâ€™s a sign that you should use this pattern!
