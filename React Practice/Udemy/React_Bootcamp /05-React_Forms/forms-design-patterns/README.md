# Passing Data Upwards to a Parent Component
**In React we generally have downward data flow. "Smart" parent components with simpler child components.**

Forms, however, involve a lot of state to make a React form work. Forms are usually used across an application so it's common to make a form into its own component. It can receive methods from the parent component and use these methods to send more data back to the parent component.
