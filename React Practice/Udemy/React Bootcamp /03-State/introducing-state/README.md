- Setting up **State** in the _constructor_ function.
- Passing **State** down to other components.
- Creating function to reset the **State** value.
- Binding functions in the _constructor_ function using the **bind()** method.
- Changing the value of **State** on click by generating a random number on the screen.

_The concept in this practice exercise was learned by following the step by step tutorial from Colt Steele's course. This exercise however, like in most of my repositories, have been done from scratch (not copied and pasted) and modified to implement previous concepts._
